Develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

Review the Chada Tech Clocks Functional Requirements, located in the Supporting Materials section.
Review the following flowchart, as it is a graphical representation of the logic you will use in relation to your applicationâ€™s sequence of functions. A text version of this flowchart is available: Project One Flowchart Text Version.

Note: This assignment represents a simulation of clock functionality. It does not need to display your local time zone, and it does not need to run in real time or tick.

Your code should be properly modularized and written in functions so that your main() has the least amount of code.
Before you begin coding, remember that you must demonstrate industry standard best practices in all your code to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency. This includes:
Inserting in-line comments to denote your changes and to briefly describe the functionality of the code
Using appropriate variable, parameter, and other naming conventions throughout your code
When your solution is finished, zip your project including all components (CPP, H, and any other files used).
Upload your zipped project file to the project submission area.# Chada-Tech-Clocks-
